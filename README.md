# Restaurant Landing Page - React.js

Welcome to the README file for the Restaurant Landing Page project! This project was developed using React.js + Vite and aims to create an eye-catching UI and brand showcase for a restaurant. In this README, you will find information about the project structure, installation instructions, and additional details to help you get started.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
├── src/
│   ├── Assets/            # Contains static files like images & videos
│   ├── components/        # Contains reusable components
│   ├── constants/         # Contains static files
│   ├── container/         # Contains section components
│   ├── App.jsx            # Main component of the application
│   ├── index.css          # Contains global styles
│   └── main.jsx           # Entry point of the application
├── public/
│   ├── index.html         # HTML template file
│   └── ...
├── .gitignore             # Git ignore file
├── package.json           # Project dependencies and scripts
└── ...
```

The `src` directory contains the main source code of the application. The `components` directory holds reusable components such as headers, footers, menus, and cards. The `pages` directory contains individual pages of the website, such as Home, About, Contact, etc. The `styles` directory includes global styles and CSS files for styling the components.

The `public` directory contains the static assets and the `index.html` file, which serves as the HTML template for the application.
